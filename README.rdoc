== Namer

This is a small application that allows for a group of people to brainstorm a name for a project, activity or anything at all.

=== Features

* Multiple projects for brainstorming names
* Anonymous name suggestions
* Anonymous votes (with minimal security)

Currently, the project implements very minimal security, as trust among the users is assumed.
