# Namer

This is a small application that allows a group of people to brainstorm a name for something without gathering into the same room at the same time.

### Features

* Multiple projects for brainstorming names
* Anonymous name suggestions
* Anonymous votes (with minimal security)

Currently, the project implements very minimal security, as trust among users is assumed.
